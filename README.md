# dotfiles

This is a collection of my dotfiles. Right now I'm using  
- neovim and lazyvim as my main text editor.
- zsh as my shell, with powerlevel10k and zsh-autosuggestions.
- iterm2 as my terminal emulator.
- tmux for something (as soon as I learn how to use it).
- karabiner-elements to remap caps lock to escape (I tried mapping it to control when held, didn't like it). I also have a few keybinds to save my pinky fingers when switching between tabs/desktops.
