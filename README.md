# dotfiles

This is a collection of my dotfiles. Right now I'm using  
- lazyvim for my main text editor.
- zsh as my shell, with powerlevel10k and zsh-autosuggestions.
- alacritty as my terminal emulator.
- tmux for terminal multiplexing (i finally kinda get it now).
- karabiner-elements to remap caps lock to escape and vice-versa (I tried mapping it to control when held, was too slow for my liking).
